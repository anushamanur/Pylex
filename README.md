# Python-lexer

### About

Lexical analysis is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens (strings with an assigned and thus identified meaning). A program that performs lexical analysis may be termed a lexer, tokenizer, or scanner. A lexer is 
generally combined with a parser, which together analyze the syntax of programming languages, web pages, and so forth. In this implementaion, a python lexer has been simulated, which takes python files as input and the breaks down the code into tokens. The tokens are then classified into pinto one of the following categories: 
* Keywords
* Identifiers
* Operators
* Constants
* Comments
